## How to contribute

1. Create an Issue describing the problem you have. If the issue already exists, let people know that you want to work in the issue by saying so :smile:
2. Create a local branch starting with the issue number and then with some words related to the feature, as an example "1-cool-feature"
3. Start to hack in your local branch :boom:
4. Be sure to write test for your code. It should be tested. 
5. Commit your work as you go. Check the commit structure in the `contributing.json` file.
6. Push your branch and open a pull request. The pull request should close an issue (most of the times it should).
7. Get ready for review. Someone should review your work and you should discuss it to make sure we are on the good path.
8. After a discussion you get approved to merge and Travis CI and GitMagic say that you can merge.
9. Merge it ! :ship:

Some contribution rules are being forced by GitMagic. Don't be afraid to make a mistake :satisfied:. It is OK. And GitMagic will tell you what is wrong :cop:. The rules are defined in `contributing.json` and you can check the meaning of each rule here: https://gitmagic.io/rules/
