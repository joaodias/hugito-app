# Hugito Static Website Content Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joaodias/hugito-app.svg?token=sUutqTfvfqWU1UcqaFtD)](https://travis-ci.com/joaodias/hugito-app)

Hugito lets you manage your static website content generated by [HUGO](https://gohugo.io). It has the CMS feeling and it is intended to be as friendly as possible so that common users can edit content on a static website with no pain.

## Roadmap
- [x] Github Integration and Authentication
- [x] Content Editing in Markdown with live preview
- [x] Get, Create, Update and Delete content from a HUGO generated website
- [x] Multiple Repositories (Enabling multiple websites on one repository)
- [ ] Database Integration, so that not an intermediary persistence layer is created between the client and Github.
- [ ] [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) configuration editing
- [ ] Improved Markdown Editor
- [ ] Open for your input :)
