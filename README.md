If you want take a look at the [Hugito frontend repository](https://github.com/joaodias/hugito-frontend)

Hugito lets you manage your static website content generated by [HUGO](https://gohugo.io). It has the CMS feeling and it is intended to be as friendly as possible so that common users can edit content on a static website with no pain.

Hugito = HUGO + Git

The content is hold in Github and managed in the Hugito platform.

## Deployement
Application Deployed in: www.hugito.herokuapp.com

## How to Contribute
The contribution rules are being forced by GitMagic. Don't be afraid to make a mistake :satisfied:. It is OK. And GitMagic will tell you what is wrong :cop:. The rules are defined in `contributing.json` and you can check the meaning of each rule here: https://gitmagic.io/rules/

### Important Considerations
The application uses some environment variables that must be configured prior to the execution. These variables are different depending on the environment they are used: development and production. Be careful to point to the right `.env` file before start developing and before opening a pull request. These variables can be configured in `main.go`.

## Roadmap
- [x] Github Integration and Authentication
- [x] Content Editing in Markdown with live preview
- [x] Get, Create, Update and Delete content from a HUGO generated website
- [x] Multiple Repositories (Enabling multiple websites on one repository)
- [ ] Database Integration, so that not an intermediary persistence layer is created between the client and Github.
- [ ] [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) configuration editing
- [ ] Improved Markdown Editor
- [ ] Open for your input :)
